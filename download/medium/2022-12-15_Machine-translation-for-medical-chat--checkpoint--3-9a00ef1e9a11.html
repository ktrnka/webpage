The weight of each arc in the lattice is proportional to the probability of its corresponding translation. Initially, the visual representation may be confusing to interpret, but once the idea is understood, it is fairly easy to read and provides insight into the ambiguity of the translation process.</p><figure name="6dfb" id="6dfb" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*KWWg4RFn7iBzA_SLagsRrA.png" data-width="1404" data-height="428" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*KWWg4RFn7iBzA_SLagsRrA.png"></figure><p name="6015" id="6015" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">In addition, the researchers propose a novel approach for dealing with out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. Rather than simply leaving these words untranslated, they suggest searching for images of the OOV words on Flickr and displaying the images alongside the untranslated words. This approach offers a unique way to handle OOVs and provides additional context for the reader.</p><p name="8a0d" id="8a0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The visual is too complex for the chat interface in my project.

Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Intelligent user interfaces</p><p name="1bf9" id="1bf9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This paper focuses on the role of machine translation in facilitating communication between people who speak different languages. The study found that misunderstandings are common in such interactions, and that both parties may think they have successfully communicated when in fact they have not.</p><p name="8610" id="8610" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The researchers make a distinction between stated misconceptions, which are related to mistranslations, and unstated misconceptions, which arise from assumptions made by one or both parties. They also discuss the potential use of lexical chains, which are sequences of words that are related in meaning, to help identify misunderstandings.</p><p name="ac8d" id="ac8d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I didn’t understand all of the paper. In particular, it is unclear how the researchers are annotating misconceptions and measuring the success of their methods. The core idea seems to be that people often switch topics when they do not understand each other, and it can be detected using lexical chains.</p><p name="51fd" id="51fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Overall, the study raises the possibility that misconceptions caused by machine translation can be automatically detected in certain kinds of chat.</p><p name="732c" id="732c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In doctor-patient communication, typically the doctor leads the conversation and the patient follows. I don’t think the method of lexical chains would help identify situations in which the patient misunderstands the doctor, but may identify situations in which the doctor misses some information from the patient. Unfortunately that would be a special-case solution for only one type of miscommunication; I’d prefer to find a more general-purpose solution.</p><h4 name="f01d" id="f01d" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Evaluation and Usability of Back Translation for Intercultural Communication</h4><p name="9d84" id="9d84" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Shigenobu, T.

They argue that simply providing back-translation is not enough, and that the user interface (UI) must also be designed carefully to enable users to easily identify and correct mistakes. (I agree!)</p><p name="2439" id="2439" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In their experiment, the researchers used back-translation in a non-native speaker (NNS) machine translation (MT) scenario, where the back-translation was used as a feedback loop to help the author revise their original input. They found that the quality of the back-translation was highly correlated with the quality of the forward translation, although the back-translation was on average 20% worse.</p><p name="4718" id="4718" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The researchers also developed a real-time translation system that attempts to identify parts of the input that are “translation unstable” and highlight them to the user. However, they do not provide much detail on how this is done.

The system is designed for non-native speakers of Japanese, and allows users to select from a range of pre-defined icons to communicate their intended meaning. The icons are organized into a hierarchy of categories, making it easier for users to find the appropriate icons for their needs.</p><figure name="5b68" id="5b68" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*hvkHJxKn51nNqM0ebfEvGQ.png" data-width="1144" data-height="1014" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*hvkHJxKn51nNqM0ebfEvGQ.png"></figure><p name="884b" id="884b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">While the idea of using icons for communication has potential, there are some challenges with the approach. For example, the hierarchical categorization of icons may be difficult for users to navigate. Additionally, it may assume the user has awareness of Japanese verb conjugation.</p><p name="bc54" id="bc54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Overall I found it interesting but didn’t take away implications for my work.</p><h4 name="e34f" id="e34f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Can Indicating Translation Accuracy Encourage People to Rectify Inaccurate Translations?</h4><p name="bae0" id="bae0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Miyabe, M., &amp; Yoshino, T.

They use BLEU scores on back-translations to assess the accuracy of the translations.</p><p name="76e6" id="76e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The researchers tested three different indicators of translation accuracy: percentage, a 5-point scale, and a 3-point scale. However, the scales were presented in words rather than visual aids, which may have affected the results. The study focused on Japanese translation.</p><p name="8306" id="8306" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The researchers also had users attempt to repair inaccurate translations. They found that the 5-point scale was the preferred indicator of translation accuracy, but that the indicators did not significantly affect users’ judgments of the accuracy of the translations.</p><p name="4eb3" id="4eb3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">(Rapp, 2009) found that BLEU wasn’t good at measuring back-translation quality, so this isn’t entirely surprising.

Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on human factors in computing systems</p><p name="a220" id="a220" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The researchers in this study explore the use of highlighting to improve the user experience of machine translation. Their hypothesis is that highlighting certain words in the translated text can make it easier to understand and increase trust in the translation. For example, in the case of the poorly-translated sentence “Was in Beijing on a six point document send out,” highlighting the keywords “Beijing” and “six o’clock” might make it easier to infer the intended meaning, which was “Need to send this document out by six o’clock Beijing time.”</p><p name="33e1" id="33e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To test their hypothesis, the researchers conducted a user study comparing no highlighting, human-selected keyword highlighting, and random highlighting. The study involved Chinese-English machine translation (presumably using Google Translate) and had users engage in MT-mediated chat to complete brainstorming tasks.</p><figure name="e2cd" id="e2cd" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*9kJi2yS8k-k94yL0zNPDqA.png" data-width="700" data-height="712" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9kJi2yS8k-k94yL0zNPDqA.png"></figure><p name="51f9" id="51f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The researchers found that keyword highlighting was rated as the most clear, while random highlighting was less clear than no highlighting. They also found that participants had a slightly higher impression of their conversational partner when keyword highlighting was used.</p><p name="2786" id="2786" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Overall, this study provides some evidence that highlighting can improve the user experience of machine translation.</p><p name="cda0" id="cda0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The examples show nearly-unintelligible English translations.

The system is designed to be used in a star trek communicator type of device, and incorporates a number of features to minimize errors and improve the user experience.</p><p name="412c" id="412c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One key aspect of the system is the use of confirmation strategies, such as requiring the user to confirm the output of the automatic speech recognition (ASR) before it is sent to the machine translation (MT) and text-to-speech (TTS) components. The researchers also incorporate a number of other techniques to improve the quality of the ASR, including a large vocabulary and the use of a high-quality grapheme-to-phoneme (g2p) dictionary.</p><p name="5ecc" id="5ecc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The user experience was designed to be simple and intuitive, and meant to support eyes-free communication. Press YOU for push-to-talk for yourself, HIM for the other person. There’s a way to review what it heard, and also it’ll start speaking the translation after a delay. If you don’t like it you can just push YOU to start over.</p><p name="340f" id="340f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The researchers explored the use of back-translation and quality estimation (which they call confidence estimation) to improve the MT component of the system. They found that back-translation with METEOR scoring was not as effective as a confidence measure based on translation consistency, but that both approaches were useful. I think they set a threshold on the score for the system to ask the user to repeat themselves.</p><p name="6202" id="6202" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I enjoyed this paper — It presents a complete system with a range of research. In addition to the research I’ve summarized, they also dealt with challenges in speech recognition and machine translation as well.</p><p name="15b8" id="15b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t think the details are applicable to MT-mediated chat in healthcare though. At a high level though I’m inspired by how simple their system is.</p><h4 name="a214" id="a214" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Improving machine translation by showing two outputs</h4><p name="3e30" id="3e30" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Xu, B., Gao, G., Fussell, S.

This could include using quality estimation models to help users assess the accuracy of the translation, and providing easy access to backtranslation and bilingual dictionaries.</p><p name="02dd" id="02dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finally, the authors suggest exploring ways to make machine translation more interactive and adaptable. This could include allowing users to prioritize the accuracy of certain words or phrases, and utilizing contextual information such as chat history to improve the quality of the translations. These ideas could be useful for designing the user interface of a healthcare chat system.</p><p name="6fda" id="6fda" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Overall it’s a good read!

The bot uses word frequency analysis to identify and interrupt the conversation to ask for clarification on words that NNS are unlikely to know.</p><p name="2047" id="2047" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Three conditions were tested in the study: the use of the ASR/TTS bot, a “dumb” baseline version of the bot, and no bot at all. The results of the study showed that the ASR/TTS bot was effective in helping NNS communicate more evenly with native speakers (NS), and that even the baseline version of the bot was useful at times.</p><p name="b2ba" id="b2ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Participants in the study reported several benefits of using the ASR/TTS bot, including that it allowed NNS to ask for clarification without feeling embarrassed or self-conscious, and that it helped to bridge the gap in understanding complex words. Additionally, the bot’s interruptions would sometimes “buy time” for NNS to try and understand the conversation before NS moved on.</p><p name="bb79" id="bb79" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Interestingly, the researchers also found that exposure to the ASR/TTS bot caused NS to change their behavior in subsequent sessions, making them more aware of their vocabulary choices and more likely to explain or avoid complex words.</p><p name="6bac" id="6bac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In my project, the core idea of asking for clarification of complex words might make sense, similar to (Robertson et al., 2021)’s TranslatorBot.</p><p name="505a" id="505a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Additionally, I like the study’s approach of placing the burden of clarification on the speaker rather than the listener (who is already struggling). I could imagine more focus on writing tools rather than just trying to support the reader. I also like how the authors were aware of social dynamics and wanted to alleviate stress from the non-native speakers because they were already stressed. In a healthcare chat setting it might be similar to place more burden on the doctors to have effective communication rather than just giving patients a way to look up definitions of words. Although my solutions are unrefined in this area, I agree with the perspective of unburdening the disadvantaged party.</p><h4 name="eaeb" id="eaeb" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Backtranslation Feedback Improves User Confidence in MT, Not Quality</h4><p name="05dd" id="05dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Zouhar, V., Novák, M., Žilinec, M., Bojar, O., Obregón, M., Hill, R.

One downside is that it places more burden on the reader, who may already be struggling.</li></ul><p name="60c1" id="60c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">I’m not optimistic about:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="298f" id="298f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Quality estimation for understanding — There are mixed results of using this in systems, and it’s very hard to have reliable QE models especially with good NMT models.</li></ul><h4 name="f3de" id="f3de" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Directions that may help to write for MT</h4><ul class="postList"><li name="1906" id="1906" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h4">Back-translation for review — I’m optimistic about back-translation because it’s so widely used even in healthcare. That said, it needs more work to ensure that it actually helps people assess translation quality rather than increasing trust without increasing quality.</li><li name="2e25" id="2e25" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Flag “unstable” phrases — This seems worth exploring. It might be hard to keep latency low if I’m using web APIs though.</li><li name="5c55" id="5c55" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Redirect towards pre-translated databases — I’ve read about multiple successes from pretranslated content. I’m not sure if I want to build such a database for this project, but I might consider using an already-existing database if one is available. In a company, this would be a great option — It’s simple and reliable. Moreover, there’s already pressure to standardize physician content anyway so the database may exist depending on your company.</li><li name="a352" id="a352" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Automatically ask for clarification on rare words — The paper that did this in a speech system was quite effective. There might be a way to use click data on definitions to bootstrap data on word familiarity in secondary languages.</li></ul><p name="af9f" id="af9f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">These directions may help for writing in a secondary language, once the writer knows enough:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="5e3b" id="5e3b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Word completion, possibly with the Google Docs interface — Once the doctor is learning Spanish, I bet ideas from CAT like word completion would help a lot. The big questions I have are 1) What’s the best way to use the other person’s chat as context into the language model? 2) How can we make sure that the user double-checks the content, even when rushed?</li></ul><p name="c6af" id="c6af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">I’m not optimistic about:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="7de2" id="7de2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Suggesting revision based on quality estimation</li><li name="92b9" id="92b9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Detecting misunderstandings with lexical chains</li></ul><h4 name="f491" id="f491" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Other directions</h4><p name="df6d" id="df6d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The quality of message (QoM) paper was interesting, and the papers showing that ESL communication was often better than relying on MT. I wonder if the chat could start by helping the doctor and patient decide the best communication strategy based on their language proficiencies, MT quality, and any medical risk factors in the case? For instance something like this:</p><figure name="abb2" id="abb2" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*afhllOf-GtOrgDAs4-N9Eg.png" data-width="1062" data-height="954" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*afhllOf-GtOrgDAs4-N9Eg.png"></figure><p name="fbf7" id="fbf7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The one thing I missed was how to analyze the patient’s case — the medical severity and urgency of the case should be considered in deciding the best option.</p><p name="2dc1" id="2dc1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have a hunch that rapport is even more important in MT-mediated chat. The literature had hints that it may be critical to weathering all the communication challenges. I bet there’s a way to give physicians more of an opportunity to establish rapport with one or two automated questions.</p><h3 name="be57" id="be57" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Assorted other observations</h3><p name="978f" id="978f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">BBN TransTalk would’ve been a good fit for hospitals, in contrast with Converser. The Converser papers often mentioned challenges like needing to cart around a laptop or users struggling with the interface. TransTalk was much simpler and more portable so I think it would’ve worked well.</p><p name="44e9" id="44e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m optimistic about some changes in research direction of the field:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="f841" id="f841" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">I’d love to see medical machine translation corpora split up more, for instance patient-doctor communication (chat, pamphlets, informational websites), doctor-doctor communication (clinical notes), scientist-scientist (academic papers).</li><li name="868c" id="868c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">It’s worth replicating some older experiments from before the advent of high quality neural machine translation.</li><li name="5fef" id="5fef" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">I’d love to see machine translation competitions emphasize adequacy or fitness for task. For instance in the medical field measuring diagnostic accuracy, triage accuracy, or treatment accuracy.</li><li name="82ae" id="82ae" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">I find myself pondering the differences between the fields of human-computer interaction (HCI) and user experience (UX). It’s often hard to articulate the differences between the fields, but I found while reading so many HCI papers that there’s often a lack of attention to detail in the user interface, ranging from the readability of fonts to layout to clutter. Papers often focus on one main change, but that change is being evaluated in the context of all the little details of the user interface.</li></ul><h3 name="aaed" id="aaed" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">What’s next?

I wonder how hard it would be to build a system for them? If I build a web system that people can use for chat as a demo, it might be worthwhile to include a page for pamphlet translation.</li><li name="3478" id="3478" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">I’d love to do a user study and actually publish if possible, but I’m not sure if I’ll have the time or money for it when I get that far. I’d particularly like to develop an adequacy aka “is it good enough” metric for diagnosis and treatment, because my experience in healthcare is that diagnosis and treatment are often inexact.</li></ul><h3 name="8d08" id="8d08" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">Appendix: Notes on using ChatGPT</h3><p name="d5aa" id="d5aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I had taken notes on all the papers, but those aren’t suitable for distribution. I thought it might be good to try using ChatGPT to convert those notes into narrative form; my experience is that it can’t really generate true information aside from general knowledge, but it can generate content that’s consistent with the input, so if the information is in the input it should be able to do it.
