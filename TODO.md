# TODO — import keith-trnka.com

Branch: `import/keith-trnka-com`

- [x] Get profile/header image(s) into `webpage/assets/` — added `webpage/assets/img/profile.jpg` (resized with ImageMagick)
- [ ] Recreate site styling (fonts/colors) so imported pages match original look (`assets/css`)
- [x] Improve `publications.md` using `download/publications.html` — rebuilt; local PDFs linked from `assets/pdf/`
- [x] Import "Other" pages: `Photos`, `Hiking tips`, `Urban detrashing tips` — converted and moved into site root
- [x] Move imported pages out of `webpage/imported-keith-trnka/` into `webpage/` (overwrote temp `index.md`)
- [x] Publication PDFs: linked from `webpage/assets/pdf/` (user-provided)
- [ ] Review and approve assets to include (images, PDFs, fonts)

Notes:
- Raw HTML snapshots are in `download/`.
- Imported content now lives in `webpage/` (the temporary `imported-keith-trnka/` folder was removed).
- Working branch: `import/keith-trnka-com`.

Next actions:
- Add profile/header image when you provide the source (I won't copy from Google-hosted URLs without your permission). 
- If you want styling matched, tell me whether to copy fonts/colors from the snapshot or hand-tune `assets/css`.
- I can open a PR for review when you're ready.
