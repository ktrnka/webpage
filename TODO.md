# TODO — import keith-trnka.com

Branch: `import/keith-trnka-com`

- [ ] Get profile/header image(s) into `webpage/imported-keith-trnka/assets/` (ask before copying from Google-hosted URLs)
- [ ] Recreate site styling (fonts/colors) so imported pages match original look (`assets/css`)
- [ ] Improve `publications.md` using `download/publications.html` (curl saved raw HTML)
- [ ] Import "Other" pages: `Photos`, `Hiking tips`, `Urban detrashing tips` (placeholders added; fill from `download/` if available)
- [ ] Optionally download publication PDFs into `webpage/imported-keith-trnka/papers/` (need confirmation)
- [ ] Review and approve assets to include (images, PDFs, fonts)

Notes:
- Imported pages are under `webpage/imported-keith-trnka/`.
- Raw HTML snapshots will be in `download/` to help conversion.
