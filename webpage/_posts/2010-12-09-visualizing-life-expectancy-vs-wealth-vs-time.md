This is an excellent use of visualization to explain or analyse data.  It's really a shame he didn't play it more slowly and explain more of the data.
Can you imagine how much harder it would be to see the trends in raw data?  Or to try and do a three dimensional graph for each country?  In general, I strongly suggest putting a little time into making data easy to interpret - I tend to notice more trends that way and it's so much easier to explain graphical data.
My only concern about the video is that the income isn't clear - are dollars normalized to 1800 dollars (accounting for inflation)?  Is there a stronger or weaker correlation if income is represented in terms of typical essentials (food, clothes)?
