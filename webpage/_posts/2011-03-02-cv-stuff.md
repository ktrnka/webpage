If using LaTeX for your vita, it's a good idea to put each of the sections in different files and include with input commands. The advantage is that now you can have several versions of the same CV linked to the same underlying data. For example, a teaching CV would have teaching/TA experience closer to the front of the document than in a research or RnD CV.
Of course there are many ways to go about it and you may want certain sections in only one version or another, but it's a good start. The one thing I'd like to be able to add is the ability to have some options in each of the sections that are automatically generated based on some parameter of the include. For example, you might not want a paragraph-description of your dissertation in your teaching CV, but you might want that in a research/RnD CV.
Also, I found I spent way too much time dealing with colors. I needed to darken some colors for normal printers and guess-and-check ends up changing the hue too much. So I had to convert from 0-1 rgb values to hex codes to hsv, then scale the value, then convert in the reverse direction.
