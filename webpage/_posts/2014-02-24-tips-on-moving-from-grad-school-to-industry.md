title: Tips on moving from grad school to industry
date: 2014-02-24
---
After finishing my PhD and teaching for a semester, I joined Swype as a Software Engineer. My focus was on researching and developing language modeling improvements; it wasn't just coding away.
But there were loads of things I didn't understand at first. There are still aspects of industry that surprise me.
Biggest things first:

* Financial stability
* Time off. I suspect because of grad school, I still don't remember when holidays are.
* A schedule. You're working with people, so you align to their schedule. In my grad school days, my schedule didn't matter except for rare meetings.

* [Excerpts from StackExchange on ArsTechnica](http://arstechnica.com/author/stack-exchange): There are some gems in there, like [enforced coding style](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/06/is-it-a-good-idea-to-impose-uniform-code-format-for-all-developers/), [operator overloading](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/05/why-arent-user-defined-operators-more-common/), or one of them pointed me to [The Way of Testivus](http://www.agitar.com/downloads/TheWayOfTestivus.pdf), which inspired me in unit testing.
