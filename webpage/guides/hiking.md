# Hiking tips

When I first moved to Seattle and started hiking, I struggled to keep up with my friends on the trail and then I'd be sore for days afterwards. These tips should help if you're in a similar situation.

## Your first hikes

Focus on the basics:

- Go with a friend that's hiked before — they can handle directions and permits.
- Wear comfortable clothes and be prepared to sweat.
- Wear comfortable shoes that can get dirty.
- Bring layers (jacket / hat / gloves) in case it's cold or rainy.
- Bring more water than you expect — 2 liters is a good starting point.
- Bring some food (I like granola bars while hiking).
- Bring sunscreen.
- Go to the bathroom before getting on the trail.

If you lack confidence, try walking hilly parks until it feels comfortable.

### If your friends are faster than you

- Train your legs: walk/hill runs, treadmill at incline, squats, etc.
- Hiking poles or a sturdy walking stick reduce leg strain and improve stability.
- Use a water bladder/backpack — people who sip more water keep going longer.
- Eat a hearty breakfast (slow-digesting calories) and snack as you go.
- Caffeine (cold brew, etc.) can noticeably improve endurance and reduce soreness.
- Don't worry about falling behind a little — focus on finishing safely.

You're going to have good days and bad days while developing endurance — that's normal.

### After the hike

- Stretching afterwards can reduce muscle soreness.
- Even if you drank a lot, you probably need more water after the hike.
- Delayed-onset muscle soreness (24+ hours later) is common after a hard hike.

## If you start hiking more

### Safety from injury

The most common issues are soreness, ankle sprains, scrapes, and falls. Hiking boots and poles help prevent sprains and falls. Be extra careful on loose or wet downhill sections.

### Safety from getting lost

Most hikes won't have cell service. For getting to/from the trailhead, download offline maps in Google Maps.

If a trail is less popular, bring a map — good options:

- [CalTopo](https://caltopo.com/map.html) — print maps and put them in a ziploc.
- [AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/) — download offline maps (paid feature).
- Backcountry app: [Backcountry Navigator (Play Store)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crittermap.backcountrynavigator.license&hl=en_US) — download topo maps.

If you have a trail description, save it offline to your phone.

## What to bring — the extended list

The basics, in priority order:

1. Water — dehydration is one of the biggest risks.
2. Navigation — app, map + compass, etc.
3. Layered clothing — adjust for heat/cold/wet.
4. First-aid — bandaids, antiseptic, pain reliever.
5. Food.
6. Sun protection.

### Situational needs

- Headlamp / flashlight (if you'll finish near sunset).
- Water filter (if you need to carry less water).
- Fire starter (lighter in a ziploc).
- Bug spray (check trail reports).
- External battery for phone.
- Microspikes / traction for icy conditions.
- Sunglasses (important on snow).
- Knife / multitool for longer treks.

### For a more luxurious experience

- Comfy shoes/sandals to change into after the hike.
- Bonus food at the summit or in the car (cheese, cold brew, etc.).
- Small brush to clean mud off shoes before getting in the car.

## Planning hikes

If you're in Washington, use [WTA](https://www.wta.org/) — the hike finder and trail reports are very helpful. Check distance, elevation gain (ft/mile), terrain, and recent trail reports. Also check weather for the trailhead and summit.

AllTrails is my main source outside Washington.
