# Urban detrashing tips

## Urban cleanups

### Your first litter pick up

Start small with an old grocery bag or a bucket. If you have gloves that's great — if not, kitchen tongs work well.

### What to go for, and why

- **Plastics** — they break down into microplastics, enter waterways/food chains, and can choke pets. Picking up large plastics early prevents them being shredded into many small pieces.
- **Glass shards** — keep them out of shoes and away from pets; pack shards in a thick container or use other trash as a buffer so they don't tear bags.
- **Rusty metal** — to reduce tetanus risk.
- **Sharp metal** (nails, wire) — prevents popped tires.
- **Food containers / cups** — coatings often prevent biodegradation.
- **Glass bottles** — easier to clean up before they're broken.
- **Soda cans** — satisfying and easy to pick up.
- **Covid masks** — they break down slowly; pick them up when possible.
- **Garbage blocking drains** — can cause localized flooding.
- **Cigarette butts** — they leach chemicals; I sometimes pick up a subset because they are numerous.

### Items I pick up less

- **Tissues / napkins** — break down quickly and add weight.
- **Cardboard** — usually degrades quickly.
- **Clothes** — heavy and often will break down.

### Rare items

- **Needles** — rare; if found keep them in a glass-safe container for disposal.
- Larger bulky items I generally leave unless in a group with dedicated pickup.

## Where the litter is / isn't

### High litter areas

- Schools
- Abandoned businesses
- Bus stops
- Construction areas

### Low litter areas

- Single-family residential away from arterials
- Active businesses
- Certain well-maintained parks

## Safety tips

- When cleaning roadsides, face traffic so you can see vehicles.
- Brush items into the curb before picking them up; watch for parked cars that may move.
- Wear gloves and/or use grabbers/tongs.
- Stay off private property.
- If someone is camping/sleeping, don't disturb them.

## Special case: Seattle

- Seattle's Adopt-a-Street program supplies heavy trash bags, gloves, grabbers, high-visibility vests, and will collect bags left at city trash cans.
- Report large dumping sites with Seattle's "Find It, Fix It" app.

## Related: Graffiti / Stickers

Priorities: remove hate speech and anything affecting safety (e.g., obscured traffic signs) first; directional or cosmetic stickers are lower priority.

My kit: household cleaners and simple tools. Options I've used include: glass scraper / razor blade, soap & water, multi-purpose cleaner, glass cleaner, isopropyl alcohol, mineral spirits, magic eraser, scraper/putty knife, rags, scrub brushes, old toothbrushes.

Approach:

- Start with the least-damaging method (soapy water, scrubbing) and escalate only if needed.
- Use a glass scraper carefully (shallow angle, slicing motion) and wear gloves.
- Test in a small corner before aggressive cleaning; avoid damaging reflective surfaces on traffic signs.
